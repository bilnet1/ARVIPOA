# ARVIPOA Platform Deployment Guide

## Option 1: Replit Deployment (Recommended - Zero Configuration)

**Click the "Deploy" button in your Replit interface.**

This gives you:
- Instant live deployment at a replit.app URL
- Automatic SSL certificates
- Zero server configuration required
- Automatic updates when you make changes
- Built-in monitoring and logs

After deployment, you can:
1. Point arvipoa.org to your Replit deployment via DNS
2. Configure custom domain in Replit settings
3. Your platform runs exactly as it does in development

## Option 2: Server Deployment (Manual)

Download `arvipoa-live.tar.gz` and deploy to your Contabo server:

```bash
# On your server (vmi2359040.contaboserver.net)
ssh root@vmi2359040.contaboserver.net
cd /tmp
# Upload arvipoa-live.tar.gz here
tar -xzf arvipoa-live.tar.gz
cd arvipoa-live
./deploy.sh
```

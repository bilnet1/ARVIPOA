let’s continue with the property registration, i will start dropping the forms word docx and their rules. but let me explain it in a simple way, this is how this setting should function. 1. 

1.	In this property segment, I will categorize the registration process and identify every details here with a name/title because every details here is generally an account, Property can also be referred to as asset, Individuals and companies who signup on the websites are account owners and in this write-up may be termed as human & company/group and human for individual signup account, and company/group for company account and in actual fact, all account must first be created by an individual before a company/group account can be created and a company account comprises of either an individual alone as a sole proprietor company/group which consist of just a member as the admin/director with group members as workers/subordinates or a company made up of set of individuals/admin(s) as Limited company with group members also called workers/subordinates, and it is only an admin(s)/(director(s)/company/group creator that can add a member(s)/worker(s). A company/Group account dashboard can be viewed and controlled by all the members/directors involved in creating that company (group) account which is as simple as creating a group in a social app but subordinates/workers cannot alter or see sensitive details of that company account unless assigned as director(s)/admin(s)
2.	So during property registration, the property owner which is the applicant can either be an individual or a company which means properties can only be registered under an individual account or a company account.  
3.	The account owner will visit the property registration page that consist of LAND, BUILDING, AUTO/MACHINES, ARMS, LIVESTOCK/PETS, ELECTRONICS, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, DOMAIN NAME etc as we discussed earlier.
4.	Every property is an account that can be used by every individual or company and every property account is registered on an individual or company account name and all accounts are registered on a building property and all building properties are registered on a land registration account. Every property have a purpose of usage and rules of usage set by the owner. 
5.	Land will be registered separately among the properties and the purpose will be stated, Address of bare land without a building on it cannot be used by anyone for any transaction because no human being can live on a bare land as assumed, humans can only live in a building hence the functionality of addresses for transactions can only be tied to a building so which means it is only addresses that are tied to a building and not a land can be used by individuals and companies for transactions so bare landed property address should be prohibited for use. Every property have a Unique ID which comprise of a traditional and Digital address when registering which is used for Land and Building and rooms/spaces on the land and in the building, License is used for Auto, Arms, Electronics and other mechanical, electrical and electronic machines.
Usage Purpose Category: Domestic, Commercial, Mixed use. Domestic is when a property tag(Address and License) is set to be used for the benefit of the user and their members only without receiving any income for the usage of the tag by any member/user of the address and commercial is when the user is using the property to make income by assigning the tag(address/license) to others and mixed use is when the property tag is used for the user’s benefit and their members and also assigning the license usage to other users for a fee/income and every user here is an individual or a company., example of a domestic usage of a building/house is when a user only add members to the building.
Rules are when the property owner set rules for the property usage by users/members and those set of rules if doesn’t match with the settings of an account user, then the user cant be able to use the property for instance a property owner setting a rule that only married couples that can use their property, or foreigners are not allowed on their property, such property/address cant be used by a anyone whose account marital status is single and such address cant be used by anyone whose nationality is not a Ghanaian. So basically rules are matched with the profile of the user, a property rules that says that no pet is allowed cant be used by someone with a pet because the pet/livestock is registered on the account of the user and the user must be tied to an address so unless the user register the pet on a different address and not the one that the property owner set its address rules not to accommodate pets or unless the property owner modify the rules of the property another rules here is when the owner set it that the property must not be used for commercial purposes which means any user cant use that property address as their work address or if the property owner set the rules that the property must not be used for domestic purposes, it means the user or any user of that address cant use that address as their residential address.
Usage category: Domestic/residential, Commercial, Mixed 
Purpose of Usage: Domestic/residential: Personal use, Caretaking Will, Gift, Collateral. Personal use is when the user and his inhabitant (family, children, pets, electronics auto etc.) uses the address or are registered on that address without the value of the property being paid for by the members which means. Will is when the user transfers the property permanently to another owner without payment involved with the reason stated in a box and Gift is when the property owner transfers the property permanently to another person also without any monetary returns with the reason stated in a box named reason, Collateral is when the Property owner transfers the property to another user temporarily with period settings utilizing Google calendar that uses date and time with sms functionality to remind parties of the transaction anytime the date or time is about to be triggered or even triggered and Reasons also will be stated in the reason box or selected among the lists of reasons. Caretaking is when the property owner add members to the property without any monetary value in exchange which also has its own duration set using the Google reminder calendar features with its own reasons also stated in the reason box.  Commercial Usage category Purpose comprises of Rent, Lease, Sell, Mortgage, Auction. Rent is when the Property unique tag is assigned to a different user with a fee in exchange and with a Google calendar features to set time of usage that reminds the user and the property owner of their agreement and also with its own rules. The moment the time set expires, the tag(address/License) will be of no benefit to the user because the address wont be functional anymore for the user, which means the user cant be found on that address anymore.
Note: A property owner whose property usage category is commercial cannot use that  address for any transaction, it is only a Mixed use property address that can be used by the property owner and also exchange some part of the property value with other users. Lease and mortgage are also the same as rent with period of usage set/activated using Google calendar features and  the users we refer to here are also called tenants and inhabitants which tenants(Primary Tenants) exchange money for the address with the property owner and inhabitants don’t pay money for the address because they are added onto the address by the property owner directly/Primary Tenant.
Process of registration: When a Land is selected among the list to be registered, after every documents and form properly filled either by OCR capturing details on the document and putting all coordinates in every boxes or applicant putting them into every boxes themselves, the property owner next page is then designed with a questionnaire of what the owner want to use the land for with lists of Regular purposes listed and being chosen from and the Regular purpose comprises of Building construction(Yet to Plan/future planning, New, uncompleted, partially completed fully completed with finishing) are on the list, the yet to build/future plan button (this button when clicked asks the property owner whether they have their plans which the applicant can list in the box and upload attachment or if they want ARVIPOA Intelligent Planning, they can click the ARVIPOA INTELLIGENT PROPERTY PLANNER button which sends the applicant to the Page where they can view beautiful AI generated properties page with sketches, plans, pictures of properties with their costs to build and payment plans, stages and Estimated time of finishing, they can also see ARVIPOA certified/license architects, contractors, consultants, construction companies, civil engineers, workmen(painters, plumbers, electricians, carpenters, bricklayers etc. they can also see machineries for hiring, building equipment’ financial institutions giving loan with very low interests and long term payment plan, mortgage experts ready to support the building project etc. then the options continue after the first Yet to plan, which we have then after the building session, we have Agricultural project(which include Crop cultivation, Animal grazing, animal husbandry, poultry, Penn animal shade, Sports facilities, and when building is selected, the building form is opened to be filled. When building is selected among the list of properties to be registered, the next page/form that appears is a form asking if the land is already registered on this account or it’s a new registration and when the already registered is clicked, it displays the lands that has been registered on the account owner’s account and when a new registration is selected, a land form first appears to be filled and then followed by a building form. Then followed by purposes and tenancy agreement attached to it.


So basically a land is registered with a digital address called Main Digital Address (MDA) the digital address is generated utilizing the official Ghana GPS or other highly effective location/digital addressing system tools/other location generator like longlang.com, google location tools etc. but the tag should be represented by the Ghana GPS API and on that land account, a building is also registered with its spaces/rooms also equipped with their own Sub digital Address. So in this case what is a Main Digital Address in our ARVIPOA system? It is a digital address that is tagged on an entire landed property, an address that covers the entire landed property, other addresses generated on that land apart from the MDA is a Sub Digital Address(SDA) and the SDA is a digital address generated within a portion or space indicated on the building plan and the address generated using the official Ghana GPS within that space covers that entire space so any address generated within that space will not be recorded in the database nor recognized except the original SDA that has been originally generated within that space portion and recorded as the unique identifier of that space so an SDA generated within a 10feetby 10feet space in a room or outside space like garden/veranda as indicated on a/the submitted building plan and as entered on the building plan form covers that entire space. So please integrate latest advance tools that can make this functionality like mapping, location/address generator measurement and dimension super easy and comprehensive.
The building is then registered with its rooms and facilities like water supply, gas supply, electricity supply which consist of electricity meter type on that property, IDEIST, floor type, roof type, ceiling type, water supply types and also gas supply types (home delivery, SMART Boundary Pillars and other facilities registered onto the property as indicated on the building/space/room. Then we finally have the Energy Facilitator Agent(EFA, This is a smart socket that we install in every home for free, it is plugged into every socket as indicated on the building plan and this socket id displayed on every user’ of that building facility dashboard where every user can purchase their electricity individually which they can use individually without the interference of other users, the EFA allows the user to voice command the switch to work and the switch will come on when the user have credit on their account and  and when switched off with voice command, the EFA goes off and it is only an account user added on that property that can use it or visitor that also have enough money on their account can start using it. The EFA is designed to be plugged into the already traditional socket which then seize the electricity onto itself and supply anyone registered on that property or on the ARVIPOA website, the EFA is equipped with an inbuilt rechargeable battery that keeps the security of EFA running whenever there is power outage and also the EFA is synched with the IDEIST for proper energy update and the synchronization is done utilizing wifi/esp32 Bluetooth integration. The IDEIST which stands for Intelligent Digital Electricity Internet Transponder, a digital marvel that fill the gap between human and technology, this device is installed at the electricity pole, it receives electricity coming from the power distribution transformer and enters into a similar IDEIST device called the MIDEIST which stands for Mother Intelligent Digital Electricity Internet Supply Transponder which is located just after the transformer and  the electricity feed from the transformer enters into the SIDEIST and the MIDEIST which serve as a security watch, meter and green energy distributor transforms the feed into a digital feed and distribute the already transformed electricity fed into it  over the lines which is then received by the IDEIST hanging on the electricity pole located in the premises of the property before distributing it into the meters (Postpaid, Prepaid, Smart Meters) and then auto synchronizes with the EFAs in every room. The MIDEIST which is also equipped with an internet receiver from different sources like satellite and Telecom tower stations distributes the internet data into an  Ethernet cable that transmits the internet to the nearest IDEIST which distribute the internet data into that IDEIST for the property and their users to use and do a continuous transmission into another Ethernet cable plugged on the other side of the IDEIST that just received internet data from the MIDEIST and the continuous transmission continue into the next IDEIST and it continues until there is no IDEIST to supply anymore. An IDEIST receives internet data from MIDEIST or another preceding IDEIST and share it to the users of that home/property through another Ethernet cable plugged into it(IDEIST) and run on the same lane with the electricity cables transmitting electricity into the property meters and then the IDEIST Ethernet cable going into the house is then finally plugged into another device called the SIDEIST or even into any internet router, the SIDEIST(optional) which is equipped with about 10 electricity positive and negative input is placed around the property main switch and cables/house wiring running within the house is first connected to it before entering into the main switch. The IDEIST which is the power house importantly synchronizes with the EFA to collect data of anyone using it (EFA) and automatically charges/debit their account. The IDEIST is also equipped with a streetlight port where a powerful but yet simple bright LED streetlight is connected to it to brighten the environment and also equipped with a 360 surveillance camera that serve as a watch keeping track of intruders and recognizes only certified electrical technicians registered onto the system to work/service/install it and distinguishes between birds and human which  sends signal to the Air Support Drone whenever an unrecognized human character is spotted to tamper with it but doesn’t send signal whenever a bird is spotted on, it also has a bird chase sound that makes a sound that frighten birds spotted on the line. It also have similar behavior like the Smart Boundary Pillar, it is inbuilt with a long lasting battery that only functions during a power outage and still continue serving its security purpose but doesn’t generate electricity with its inbuilt battery, it is also equipped with a solar panel that serves as a backup power that runs the security system whenever there is a very long hours/days power outage due to fault and general maintenance. The main purpose of the IDEIST is to curb electricity thieves because originally, the flow of electricity is from the generation point (Solar, Thermal, Wind, Hydrogen etc.) to the Sub stations, continue to the transformers, and then into the meters (Postpaid, Prepaid, Smart) and this is where the problem is because before the electricity gets to the meter, the user diverts it into their own illegal source and uses stolen electricity and intentionally feeds the meter with the same electricity which is not consumed and not charged by the meter and the diverted ones are used freely by the user. Some users also intelligently connects the meter to lighter consumable electrical appliances like light bulbs and the rest and the bigger electricity gadgets like fridges, air conditioners are powered by the illegal power integrated into power source. So the user always carry out some of these thefts by removing power breakers that powers the electricity meter, they also do that whenever there is power outage and they are able to do this because the meter is installed right in their premises hence their ability to steal. The EFA is designed to report intrusion whenever it is removed from the traditional socket that is plugged into, the EFA is designed to detect intrusion whenever the Negative- and Positive+ golden metallic part plugged into the traditional socket is plugged out and stop detecting energy which send signal to the IDEIST and the IDEIST will automatically shut down the system causing power outage in that property for intrusion reasons. The IDEIST which also connect any user from any environment which means if a user who lives in the Greater Accra Region of the Republic of  Ghana found themselves at Akosombo in the Eastern Region of the Republic of Ghana they can easily connect their mobile device to any available IDEIST which charges their original account and doesn’t affect the speed of the IDEIST they are connected to because they are all on one network so IDEIST is not password protected, it is an opened source device that links any member irrespective of their location to the internet via the  nearest available IDEIST or Smart Boundary Pillar. 

So finally, a properly registered building on ARVIPOA property registration portal has a flow of LAND registered and submitted, BUILDING registered on the already registered land and finally assigned to users/members(tenants/inhabitants/facilities(electronics etc.) /pets/livestocks) either free or paid for through rent, lease, sell, mortgage etc.

“Use this mockup blueprint to create an interactive, responsive land registration form for ARVIPOA. Ensure each section is collapsible/expandable with tooltips and icons. Integrate OCR-ready site plan upload (front/back), QR scanning, and digital address generator via GhanaPostGPS API. Add map interactivity (map/satellite/terrain toggle) and clickable image-based pillar addition using the Smart Pillar image. Enable invite flow for third-party reps via OTP verification, contract uploads, title application options, and payment plan. Use sleek dark UI with ARVIPOA styling.”

one handles payment system and the other handles religious management system called the RBFS.org which comprises of churchid.org, mosqueid.org and Religion Belief and Faith(RBF.org) the platform is created for religious organizations registered on ARVIPOA to manage their members and receive donations both encrypted and opened donations from members who don’t want their donation revealed to avoid psychological disturbances and other reasons so we designed the RBFS (churches, Mosques etc. to create an account and register their churches using the right registered address from ARVIPOA property management platform so they register their religious organization like type of RBFS, example like Christianity, Islam and the rest in the dropdown, so church name: founded: founder: about church, church location utilizing Google map navigation system church services by days in the week utilizing Google calendar or other calendar settings with sms notification of event to their members services can be streamed online from their portal and their members can view on their gadgets. so after the church is registered with their logo, services location named branch etc, then members can also select their preferred RBF group (churches, Mosques etc) in the list and register on it as members just like joining a Social Media group, so the members get to see themselves on the same platform sharing stories testimonies and other contents on the platform with comments, chat features, audio and video calls and live streaming functionalities so on the same RBF platform, Christians can switch to churchID and moslems can switch to MosqueID and the other religions in the list can also switch to their platforms whiles they login on the event days of their respective RBF Organization and the RBF organization like the church  will see them online and they can also donate offerings and other donations but in an encrypted form which means the church or RBF will receive the donation but the church or RBF users will only see the encrypted details of the sender and not their real identity so for instance John Doe a member of Christ Embassy Church Adenta branch sent his donation during a Sunday service set by Christ Embassy Adenta branch and he already encrypted his sending details to “encrypt my details”, the RBF(church, mosque etc.) (Christ Embassy Adenta branch) will receive the $100 donations from John Doe into their wallet but they will only see the encrypted details of John Doe which example is “5R$%88*[?MM” because that is how he John Doe set it to be and they will see John Doe online as well but they don’t know that he sent $100 but they are aware of he making a donation but the exact amount was encrypted. So the frontend when launched displays the glowing glassy UI maintaining ARVIPOA color scheme type maybe the color may twist a bit to differentiate among other services but the same style will be maintained and churches and their logos and their news, blogs and posts can be seen on the platforms, members and other people you may know are also on the page in an oval shape, members you may know and one can tap on an RBF (church etc) and join the church as a member and the church or RBF will receive the notification as “a new member has joined” and the same process on ARVIPOA circle will take place by the church sending the member their Smart membership ID which will be handled by ARVIPOA RBF Smart Card sections, both printing and delivery just as the ARVIPOA property smart card was printed and delivered to the property owner because during registration on the RBF platform, the applicant previewed their RBF(ChurchID or MosqueID) before submitting and that is what will be delivered to them in printed version, the platform also have pages of certified religious teachers and clergymen who sells spiritual and religious products and services ranging from counseling services via ARVIPOA safe communication system utilizing audio and video calls API from either AGORA or Twillio, physical items, books etc. are also sold on the platform, books and materials used by these groups(bible, quran etc.) are also installed on each platform in digital form to enable the user utilize it as they are on the platform without having to leave the platform. RBFSs’ can set their programs with banner images and it will be displaying on their frontend with e-commerce integration for the religious leaders to sell their products and services on the RBF market. 

The same payment system was designed using laravel it is a sleek design called the payment pane and on other ARVIPOA channel it is called “foreign bird” which features about 10 modals on the main page with front and back images of currencies of different countries with the foreignbird logo displaying in them as watermark with some effect around it making the currencies front and back displays randomly which makes it look magnificent, it displays as a product with certain value attached to each currency note and there is receiver box that connect to the app contact and phonebook to fetch contact as the receiver, there are other section boxes as displayed below here with their own drop down menu:

TRANSACTION REFERENCE ID: Transaction ID can be entered here for instance if auto services are being paid for, the vehicle details will be entered in here.

The Foreign bird currency pane secured online payment system which features a contractual agreement between the sender and the receiver, utilizing attachment button features to upload files, also there is a reference box where sender can type their intentions, record voice, record video, and attach, we also set an escrow functionalities where the sender schedule the payment with reasons and send, the payment is sent and it remains with ARVIPOA until the receiver oblige by submitting proof of transaction and the sender accepting it before the receiver can receive the payment from ARVIPOA. The currency pane is actually designed to run a smooth and fair transactions in the ARVIPOA ecosystem making sure everything runs well just as it is done on Fiverr.com and the rest of the escrow platform, the receiver and sender receives debit and credit sms alert until the tasks at hand is fulfilled and proofs are submitted back on the contract page before the cash will be released and that is why we make sure physical delivery of items are done using our delivery channel where you get to see live delivery rider and live sales ongoing utilizing the live transmission system. The Currency Pane is also created as a button hovering around the ARVIPOA homepage to enable anyone tap on it and when it opened, it can be used to donate towards ARVIPOA’s initiatives, the currency pane is also designed for property owners who want to keep their identity anonymous, they used it to purchase properties on ARVIPOA platform to make sure the seller identity remains anonymous.

THE CURRENCY IMAGES: The currency images are just representation of the similar amount that would have been entered using the keyboard/keypad, we also provided an optional keypad where the user can click on and enter the value if it cant be found on the currency pane, for instance a sender who want to send $100,000.00 would have to use the keypad because there is no $100,000.00 note.

The encrypted functionality limitation: The encrypted functions are limited to only donation and the purchase of some sensitive items like medicine because we designed it to safeguard the payer who is buying for instance an HIV/AIDS retroviral medication and the buyer don’t want the seller to see their details when paying, they can encrypt the payment and the receiver will only receive the payment but will only see ARVIPOA details or an encrypted delivery details. Other payments for goods and services cant be encrypted. And whenever services are selected, the system only work with items relating to the services selected and which they are meant for in the dropdown menu for example like the government services are only meant to relate to government services only and not mixing them with other transactions.
